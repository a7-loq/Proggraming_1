# Proggraming_1_HW1

Problem 1: Write an algorithm, for finding the area of a rectangle
Hints: 
•	Area = length * width  
•	define the inputs and the outputs
•	define the steps 
•	draw the flowchart


Problem 2: Write an algorithm for finding the speed of a car traveling 200 km in 2 hours.
Hints:
•	Speed = Distance / Time
•	define the inputs and the outputs
•	define the steps 
•	draw the flowchart


Problem 3: Write an algorithm for finding the result of a student, given that the passing grade is 60. Student fail If grade is less than 60 and pass otherwise. 
Hints:
•	define the input and the output
•	define the steps 
•	draw the flowchart

Solution Problem 1: Write an algorithm, for finding the area of a rectangle.
Pseudo code Steps:
1. Start
2.Input  L
3.Input  W
4.Area=L*W
5.Output Area
6.End



Solution Problem 2: Write an algorithm for finding the speed of a car traveling 200 km in 2 hours. 
Pseudo code Steps:
1. Start
2.Input   Distance =200km
3.Input  Time=2hours
4. Speed = Distance / Time
5.Output Speed  
6.End


Solution Problem 3:  Write an algorithm for finding the result of a student, given that the passing grade is 60. 
Student fail If grade is less than 60 and pass otherwise.
Pseudo code Steps:
1.Start
2.Input grade
3.1 grade > 60=yes
    Print "you are pass"
3.2 grade <60=No
    Print "you are fail"
4. End
